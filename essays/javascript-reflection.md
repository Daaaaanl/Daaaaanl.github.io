## JavaScript Thoughts
  
  So far I think JavaScript is easy to follow and useful language. With some knowledge of C and Java, I feel like Javascript can be a lot less confusing compared to C and Java. I felt like I learned more about the format of JavaScript with the FreeCodeCamp tutorials since a bunch of the syntax is similar to Java. Something new that I thought was really interesting was the strictly equal operator( === ) since I've come across = and == before but not ===. The = operator assigns the value at the right of the operator to a variable to the left of the operator. The == operator checks if both sides have the same value and returns true if it has the same value. The === operator does the same as the == operator but will only return true if it is the same value of the same data type. I think that Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective because there is less confusion when checking what is wrong with the code because it will tell you what is wrong with your code unlike C, where it might not tell you what is wrong (i.e. when your index goes past the end of the array, it wonâ€™t tell you and it will crash). JavaScript is a well made programming language that isn't too hard to learn with its built in error notices if you have an error and simple format.

### Athletic SE and WODS

  I think that athletic software engineering is important. One of the best ways to learn is to learn by doing. By writing code more, the better you will get at it. I find practice WODs (Workout Of the Day) to be useful because it gives you problems that you may not have thought about before and it will get you thinking. In regards to the flipped style of learning, I like it because it is convenient. After watching the lecture at home, you go to class and work on problems and ask questions if you get stuck on something. If it wasn't the flipped style, when you get stuck at home doing problems, it may be a while before you can get your questions answered. It is not stressful for me because I am free to learn it on my own time and not have to worry about missing part of a lecture since I can rewind and watch it again. It is enjoyable to me because we do active learning in class so we are actually engaged in applying what we learned by watching the lecture. I think that this flipped style will work for me. In class, if I am not engaged, I may space out or get distracted with something else and miss out on parts of the lecture. Athletic software engineering and WODS go hand in hand in developing your skills, whether in programming or anything that requires practice.
