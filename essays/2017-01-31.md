summary: Thoughts on configuration management along with Git and Github
---

Configuration management is something that everyone who works with others should know. It allows groups of people working on a project or program to do work efficiently. If people were to work on a project without a way to keep track of everything being done, it would take many times longer to accomplish things if they just emailed code being worked on back and forth.


I think that Git is popular because of GitHub. Github was launched about three years after the launch of Git. Github is a git repository hosting site that allows users to do many things easily to repositories, which includes cloning, forking, and pulling among many other features.
