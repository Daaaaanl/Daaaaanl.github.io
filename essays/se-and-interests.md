The very first programming class I took was EE160, C programming with Tep during my second semester of being a freshman. I did not get a good grade for his class and decided to retake the class the next semester. The second time taking the class, I understood it much more, got a way better grade, and got me interested in programming. I talked with Gerald and switched to Computer Science during my second half of sophomore year.


I am interested in learning a lot more programming languages and hope to be able to use then well.
