# Project: Share The Umbrellas

## Overview

The problem: UH rains a lot. Umbrellas can be a hassle to carry. People usually don't carry around umbrellas so if it does rain, they will not be prepared.

The solution: The app will allow you to login and determine:
<ul>
  <li>Where are the locations of the umbrellas.</li>
  <li>Where there are umbrellas.</li>
</ul>

There will be random umbrella stations around the campus where people can leave an umbrella or take a umbrella.

<ul>
  <li>Public landing page</li>
  <li>Login page</li>
