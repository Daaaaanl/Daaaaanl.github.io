summary: Reflection on Coding Standards
---



Many people think of “coding standards” in a trivial way—i.e. minutae such as how many spaces to indent, or whether you place the close-curly-brace on a new line by itself.

I, on the other hand, think that if you can only implement one software engineering technique to improve quality, it should be coding standards. Indeed, I believe some coding standards can actually help you learn a programming language. Do you agree?

After your first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ, what are your impressions? Are you finding that getting the green checkmark is painful, or useful, or both, or something else entirely?

Write an interesting, informative essay on coding standards that addresses some or all of the above questions, or goes in a different direction entirely regarding coding standards. Make sure it provides your personal perspective and useful insights.

## Those are some pretty high standards.

I think that coding standards are an important aspect of software engineering. Coding standards should be what they were meant to be, standards. They help improve readability to minimize the amount of errors one might make while writing code. It would also help others to help diagnose what may be wrong when they look the code. If it was code with no coding standards, the person may take half their time helping you trying to figure out the format of the code so they don't get confused at what the code actually does. When I was taking ICS 211, I asked the ATA to help me out with my code on Eclipse. The first thing he always told me to do even before looking at the contents of my code was to press ctrl + shift + f to format the code. This made me more aware how I should write my code so it becomes more readable for others.

### Something seems off about the code... Quickly! Use ESLint!

ESLint with IntelliJ is something I look forward to using more of. It is very satisfying to see the little green checkmark on the upper right corner. The only think I would improve about it is if there is an error and I'm not sure what it means, it could provide more information about that said error.
