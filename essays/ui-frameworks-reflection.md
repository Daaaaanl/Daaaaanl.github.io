## Some header
Semantic UI can make things more simple and user friendly by using natural language. Using frameworks like Semantic UI and Bootstrap make web pages much more responsive and presentable.


The time and frustration spent familiarizing yourself with a framework can make your job a lot easier. Learning to use a framework can be similar to learning a new programming language, which takes quite some time. When you learn one framework, you are learning almost a lot of other frameworks with it.

## Some other header

Using raw HTML and CSS requires you to do extra work. Why do extra work if it something thatâ€™s already been done? Creating a button with raw html and css gives you some very plain buttons. Some buttons include: a plain rectangular button, a rectangular button with color, a rounded button, long and short buttons, and etc. You can spice things up with any framework. Buttons from the Semantic UI framework alone open up a whole new world of possible button types like: labeled icon buttons, toggling buttons, multiple groups of buttons together, and even dedicated buttons for social media sites! The more frameworks you know the more variety you have when creating websites.
