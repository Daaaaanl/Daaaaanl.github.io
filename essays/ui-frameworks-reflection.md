## Why Would We Use UI Frameworks? Is it worth it?

UI frameworks like Semantic UI and Bootstrap can make making web pages more simple, responsive, and beautiful. Semantic UI in particular uses human friendly HTML so you can understand it pretty easily. With UI frameworks, you won’t have to sweat about some things like margins, alignment, and layout as they are all implemented within the framework. This lets you focus most of your time on content you want to put on the web instead of focusing most of your time adjusting the space between content. The time and frustration spent familiarizing yourself with a framework can make your job a lot easier. Learning to use a framework can be similar to learning a new programming language, which takes quite some time. When you learn one framework, you are learning a bunch of other frameworks with it, as some of them are very similar to each other.

Using raw HTML and CSS requires you to do extra work. Why do extra work if it something that’s already been done? Creating a button with raw HTML and CSS gives you some very plain buttons. Some buttons include: a plain rectangular button, a rectangular button with color, a rounded button, and long and short buttons. You can spice things up with any framework. Buttons from the Semantic UI framework alone open up a whole new world of possible button types like: labeled icon buttons, toggling buttons, multiple groups of buttons together, and even dedicated buttons for social media sites! The more frameworks you know the more variety you have when creating web pages.

In using semantic UI to replicate web pages as practice, I’ve realized that there are many, many more frameworks that websites use. They each have their own special functions but are largely similar in terms of functionality. In the one week I have been learning about and using Semantic UI, replicating a web page's design has been fairly simple with a bit of practice. The few hours spent watching lectures about Semantic UI and practicing using it has been well worth the time. If you haven't tried using UI Frameworks, give it a try. It's well worth the time and effort.
