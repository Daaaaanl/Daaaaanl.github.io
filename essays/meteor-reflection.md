# Meteor Smash

Starting off with meteor, it hit me in the head and left a dent. With the very first meteor tutorial that we did. The spacebars (similar to handlebars) were a bit too much to handle.

I found the new format and use of spacebars to be pretty hard. Learning how to use a "Collection" and learning about "Publishing" and "Subscribing" was definitely something new to me. Something that would also be hard would be building everything from scratch. We had templates to follow so that made everything a lot easier.

I found being able to use JavaScript and Semantic UI to build an app to be pretty easy. Going back to using something I was more comfortable with helped me get used to Meteor faster. If everything was completely new I would probably dread learning everything from scratch. Just adding on bits of new information and understanding them made my experience with Meteor a lot better.

My first impression on meteor was, “Coolio, I can make apps with this¿¿¿”. I was surprised with what meteor had to offer. I had no prior experience with any app building platform. Meteor uses a database called “Mongo”. Mongo has something called a Minimongo which is a local version of the database. This makes retrieving data easy and fast. Meteor is also real time by default, which means once you make changes in your code, the app updates instantly!

Now I have more experience with Meteor, the dent on my head is slowly going back to normal.
